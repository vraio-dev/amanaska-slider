                                <p class="sutras">“Therefore, it is important to discover these things for ourselves because self-Knowledge cannot be given to us by another, it is not to be found through any book. We must discover and to discover, there must be the intention, the search, the inquiry. So long as that intention to find out, is to inquire deeply, is weak, or does not exist, mere assertion or a casual wish to find out about oneself is of very little significance.”</p>

                                <p class="sutras">“When man becomes aware of the movement of his own thoughts, he will see the division between the thinker and thought, the observer and the observed, the experiencer and the experience. He will discover that this division is an illusion. Then only is there pure observation, which is insight without any shadow of the past, or of time. This timeless insight brings about a deep, radical mutation in the mind.”</p>

Virtue is essential, for it gives freedom. It is only in virtue that you can discover that you can live with dignity and in freedom-not in the cultivation of virtue, which merely brings about respectability.”</p>

                                <p class="sutras">“We never consider the problem itself, but with agitation and anxiety grope for an answer, which is invariably self-projected. Though the problem is self-created, we try to find an answer away from it. To look for an answer is to avoid the problem - which is just what most of us want to do. Then the answer becomes all significant and not the problem.”</p>

                                <p class="sutras">“Knowing oneself is the ending of sorrow. We are afraid to know ourselves because we have divided ourselves into the good and the bad, the evil and the noble, the pure and the impure. The good is always judging the bad, and these fragments are at war with each other. This war is sorrow. …..This fragmentation of life into the high and the low, the noble and the ignoble, God and the devil, breeds conflict and pain. When there is sorrow, there is no love. Love and sorrow cannot live together.”</p>
